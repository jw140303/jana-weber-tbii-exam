# Jana Weber TBII Exam project

This repository includes all the files for my Tech Basics II exam project.

It includes a short report, as well as the files needed to run the MVP.
An MVP is a "Minimum Viable Product". This means that the app is not finished, but represents the idea and how it's going to work.
The MVP can be started with the 'app.py' file.

## Instructions to run my app
1. Clone my repository to your machine
2. Go into the folder you created
3. Run the app.py folder
4. Enjoy using my app! :)
