# Jana Weber TBII Exam project

This repository includes all the files for my Tech Basics II exam project.

It includes a short report, as well as the files needed to run the MVP.
An MVP is a "Minimum Viable Product". This means that the app is a prototype containing the essential features.
The MVP can be started with the 'app.py' file. 
Please do not put the app on your full screen, as it is formatted to be opened in the predefined size.
